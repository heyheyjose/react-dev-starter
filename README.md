##### Requirements / Set Up:

If you don't have Browserify, Watchify, or Babel already installed globally, first do the following:

```
$ npm install -g browserify

$ npm install -g watchify

$ npm install -g babel
```

Then clone this repo and run the following commands:

```
$ npm install

$ npm run watch
```

If you already have those 3 above installed, just "npm install" and "npm run watch", and you are ready to go!

##### Running In The Browser:

Once the above set up has been completed, just open the index.html in your browser, and if you see the message below everything is working correctly. Go forth and build :)
